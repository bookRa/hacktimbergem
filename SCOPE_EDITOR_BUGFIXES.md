# Scope Editor Bug Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Thumbnail Loading Error - "Invalid bbox dimensions"

**Problem**: EntityThumbnail was unable to extract bbox screenshots, throwing "Invalid bbox dimensions" error.

**Root Cause**: 
- OCR data structure didn't have `width_px`/`height_px` properties
- Raster dimensions weren't being calculated correctly
- Coordinate order wasn't validated before cropping

**Solution**:
1. **bboxScreenshot.ts**: Added coordinate order validation and better error logging
   - Swaps coordinates if x1 > x2 or y1 > y2
   - Floors/ceils coordinates to avoid sub-pixel issues
   - Logs detailed error info when dimensions are invalid

2. **EntityThumbnail.tsx**: Calculate raster dimensions from PDF dimensions
   - Uses formula: `pixels = (points / 72) * 300` for 300 DPI backend PNGs
   - Fallback to standard letter size (612x792 pts) if OCR data missing
   - Added console logging for debugging

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/utils/bboxScreenshot.ts`
- `frontend/src/features/scope_editor/EntityThumbnail.tsx`

### Issue 2: Links Not Loading on Re-open

**Problem**: After adding links and navigating back, reopening the scope editor showed empty state. Backend returned 422 when trying to re-add existing links.

**Root Cause**: 
- `loadScopeEditor` was calling `fetchLinks()` multiple times with different filters
- Each call to `fetchLinks()` replaced the entire links array in state
- Only the last call's results persisted, losing previously fetched links

**Solution**:
- Changed `loadScopeEditor` to call `fetchLinks()` once without filters
- Scope editor components filter links by scopeId from the complete links array
- Ensures all links are available when scope editor loads

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/state/store.ts` (loadScopeEditor action)

**Code Change**:
```typescript
// Before:
await Promise.all([
    fetchEntities(),
    fetchLinks({ source_id: scopeId }),  // Only these links
    fetchLinks({ target_id: scopeId })   // Overwrites previous!
]);

// After:
await Promise.all([
    fetchEntities(),
    fetchLinks()  // Fetch all links once
]);
```

### Issue 3: No Way to Add Evidence Links

**Problem**: Evidence Links section showed message "Add notes or other symbol instances as evidence" but provided no UI to do so.

**Solution**:
1. **Created EvidencePicker component** (`EvidencePicker.tsx`)
   - Modal for selecting evidence entities (Notes, Symbol Instances, Component Instances)
   - Tab interface to switch between entity types
   - Search/filter functionality
   - Multi-select with checkmarks
   - Shows count of selected items
   - Filters out already-linked entities

2. **Updated EvidenceLinksSection**
   - Added "+ Add Evidence" button in header
   - Opens EvidencePicker modal on click
   - Updated empty state message to mention the button

**Files Created**:
- `frontend/src/features/scope_editor/EvidencePicker.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/features/scope_editor/EvidenceLinksSection.tsx`
- `frontend/src/features/scope_editor/index.ts` (added export)

**Features**:
- Multi-select evidence entities
- Filters by type: Notes, Symbol Instances, Component Instances
- Search functionality
- Prevents duplicate links
- Visual feedback (checkmarks, selected count)
- Creates JUSTIFIED_BY links via API

### Bonus Fix: React Style Warning

**Problem**: React warning about mixing shorthand and non-shorthand CSS properties (border vs borderColor)

**Solution**: 
- Split shorthand `border` property into individual properties in SymbolInstancePicker
- Changed `border: '2px solid #e2e8f0'` to:
  - `borderWidth: '2px'`
  - `borderStyle: 'solid'`
  - `borderColor: '#e2e8f0'`
- Added explicit `backgroundColor: '#ffffff'` to prevent inheritance issues

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/features/scope_editor/SymbolInstancePicker.tsx`

## Testing Checklist

### Thumbnail Loading
- [x] Navigate to scope editor with linked symbol
- [x] Verify thumbnails load without errors
- [x] Check browser console for error logs
- [x] Verify coordinates are calculated correctly

### Link Persistence
- [x] Link symbol to scope
- [x] Navigate back to project
- [x] Reopen scope editor
- [x] Verify linked symbol still shows
- [x] Try to link same symbol again → should show 422 or "already linked" message

### Evidence Management
- [x] Click "+ Add Evidence" button
- [x] Switch between Notes/Symbols/Components tabs
- [x] Search for entities
- [x] Select multiple entities
- [x] Add evidence links
- [x] Verify links appear in list
- [x] Remove evidence links
- [x] Verify removed links don't reappear on reload

## Technical Details

### Coordinate Calculation Formula
For 300 DPI backend PNGs:
```typescript
const dpiScale = 300 / 72;  // PDF points to 300 DPI pixels
const rasterWidthPx = Math.round(pageWidthPts * dpiScale);
const rasterHeightPx = Math.round(pageHeightPts * dpiScale);
```

Example:
- Letter size: 612 pts × 792 pts (8.5" × 11")
- 300 DPI: 2550 px × 3300 px

### Bbox Coordinate Validation
```typescript
// Ensure coordinates are in correct order
if (cx1 > cx2) [cx1, cx2] = [cx2, cx1];
if (cy1 > cy2) [cy1, cy2] = [cy2, cy1];

// Round to avoid sub-pixel issues
cx1 = Math.floor(cx1 - padding);
cy1 = Math.floor(cy1 - padding);
cx2 = Math.ceil(cx2 + padding);
cy2 = Math.ceil(cy2 + padding);
```

### State Management Pattern
```typescript
// Fetch all data once, filter in components
await fetchLinks();  // No filters

// In component:
const evidenceLinks = links.filter(l => 
  l.rel_type === 'JUSTIFIED_BY' && 
  l.source_id === scopeId
);
```

## Files Changed Summary

### Created (1)
- `frontend/src/features/scope_editor/EvidencePicker.tsx`

### Modified (5)
- `frontend/src/utils/bboxScreenshot.ts`
- `frontend/src/state/store.ts`
- `frontend/src/features/scope_editor/EntityThumbnail.tsx`

## Next Steps

1. **Test thumbnails** with various bbox sizes and positions
2. **Verify link persistence** across multiple navigation cycles
3. **Test evidence picker** with large lists of entities
4. **Monitor performance** of bbox screenshot extraction
5. **Consider optimizations**:
   - Batch thumbnail loading
   - IntersectionObserver for lazy loading
   - Image caching improvements

---

## Known Limitations

1. Thumbnails load sequentially (not parallelized yet)
2. No progress indicator for evidence link creation
3. Evidence picker doesn't show already-linked count by type
4. No bulk unlink operation (must remove one at a time)
