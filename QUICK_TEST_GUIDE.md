# 🧪 Quick Test Guide: Scope Refactoring

## ✅ What Just Got Implemented

**The final piece is now complete:** 
- ✨ **"+ Add Canvas Location"** button now works!
- Users can convert conceptual scopes → canvas scopes via UI
- Full bidirectional conversion is operational

---

## 🎯 Test These 3 Key Workflows

### Test 1: Create Conceptual Scope (2 minutes)
1. Open browser to http://localhost:5173
2. Open Knowledge Panel → Explorer Tab
3. Find "Scopes" section
4. Click **"+ New Scope"**
5. Enter name: "Test Conceptual Scope"
6. Click "Create"
7. ✅ Should appear in "💭 Conceptual Scopes" section

---

### Test 2: Convert Conceptual → Canvas ⭐ NEW! (2 minutes)
1. Find the scope you just created
2. Click **"Edit"** button
3. You should see:
   - Badge: "💭 Conceptual Scope (Project-level)"
   - Button: "📍 + Add Canvas Location"
4. Click **"📍 + Add Canvas Location"**
5. Form should close, canvas enters drawing mode
6. **Draw a bounding box** anywhere on the canvas (click-drag)
7. ✅ Watch the magic happen:
   - Scope converts automatically
   - Canvas navigates to that sheet
   - Entity Tab opens showing updated scope
   - Toast: "Canvas location added to scope"
   - Scope moves to "📍 Canvas Scopes" section
   - Canvas overlay appears at bbox location

---

### Test 3: Convert Canvas → Conceptual (1 minute)
1. Edit the scope you just converted (now a canvas scope)
2. You should see:
   - Badge: "📍 Canvas Scope (Sheet-specific)"
   - Button: "🗑️ Remove Canvas Location"
3. Click **"🗑️ Remove Canvas Location"**
4. Confirm the dialog
5. ✅ Should convert back:
   - Scope moves to "💭 Conceptual Scopes"
   - Canvas overlay disappears
   - Toast: "Canvas location removed from scope"

---

## 🐛 What to Watch For

### Potential Issues
- [ ] Form doesn't close after clicking "+ Add Canvas Location"
- [ ] Drawing mode doesn't start
- [ ] After drawing bbox, nothing happens
- [ ] Conversion works but canvas doesn't navigate
- [ ] Conversion works but Entity Tab doesn't open
- [ ] Scope doesn't move between sections after conversion
- [ ] Canvas overlay doesn't appear/disappear correctly

### Console Checks
Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab. Look for:
- ✅ `[OverlayLayer] Adding location to existing scope: <scope_id>`
- ✅ No red error messages after conversion
- ❌ Any errors mentioning "addingScopeLocationTo" or "updateScopeLocation"

### Backend Checks
If conversions fail, check backend:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/backend.log
```
Look for:
- ✅ `PATCH /api/projects/.../entities/... 200 OK`
- ❌ `422 Unprocessable Entity` or `500 Internal Server Error`

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

**The refactoring is successful if:**
1. ✅ You can create a conceptual scope via "+ New Scope"
2. ✅ You can click "+ Add Canvas Location" → draw bbox → automatic conversion
3. ✅ After conversion, canvas shows the scope overlay
4. ✅ You can click "Remove Canvas Location" → scope becomes conceptual
5. ✅ No errors in browser console or backend logs
6. ✅ Scopes move between sections correctly

## 🔧 If Something Breaks

### Frontend Issue
```bash
# Check for TypeScript errors
cd frontend
npm run build
```

### Backend Issue
```bash
# Restart backend
pkill -f "uvicorn app.main:app"
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 5173 > /tmp/backend.log 2>&1 &
```

### State Corruption
```bash
# Hard refresh browser
Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux)
```

## 📊 Files Changed Summary

### Backend (3 files)
- ✅ `backend/app/entities_models.py` - Optional bbox/sheet for scopes
- ✅ `backend/app/entities_store.py` - Added source_sheet_number param
- ✅ `backend/app/main.py` - PATCH endpoint accepts source_sheet_number

### Frontend (4 key files)
- ✅ `frontend/src/state/store.ts` - Added `addingScopeLocationTo` state + `startAddingScopeLocation()` action
- ✅ `frontend/src/ui_v2/forms/InlineEntityForm.tsx` - Wired "+ Add Canvas Location" button
- ✅ `frontend/src/ui_v2/OverlayLayer.tsx` - Check for `addingScopeLocationTo` state when drawing completes
- ✅ `frontend/src/components/ScopeCreationModal.tsx` - NEW modal component

---

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Test with zoom:** Try converting at different zoom levels to ensure form appears correctly
2. **Test multiple conversions:** Convert conceptual → canvas → conceptual → canvas to verify state doesn't corrupt
3. **Test with rotated pages:** Draw bbox on a rotated page to ensure bbox is calculated correctly
4. **Test duplicate names:** Create two scopes with the same name to verify duplicate detection
5. **Test linking:** Link a scope to a symbol instance before/after conversion

---

## ✨ What's Next?

After testing, you can:
1. ✅ Start using scopes in your real projects
2. ✅ Link scopes to symbol/component instances
3. ✅ Create scope hierarchies (parent/child relationships)
4. ✅ Build scope templates for common use cases
5. ✅ Generate scope analytics dashboards
